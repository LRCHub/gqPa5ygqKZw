Getting together
Or being apart
It's so hard to do
Leave if you've gotta
Stay if you want now
It's up to you
It must seem like some crazy dream
That you're living through
When you're lying around
In some far-off town
Making love to someone new

Letter from the road
Telling me
That you won't be coming back
I don't know
All I get are these letters
From the road

If we're though
It's up to you to let me know the score
If we're not, it's time that you
Come home with the show once more

All these lonely, lonely, lonely nights
In the back rooms of your life
It's hard to lose
When you've paid your dues
Oh, it cuts you like a knife

Letters from the road
Telling me
That you won't be coming back
I don't know
All I get are these sad and lonely
Letters from the road
Telling me
That you won't be coming back
I don't know
All I get are these sad and lonely
Letters from the road

(Repeat last verse twice).
