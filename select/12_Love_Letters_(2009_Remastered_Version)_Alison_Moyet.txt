Love letters straight
From your heart
Keep us so near
While apart

I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love
That you write
I memorize every line
And I kiss the name
That you sign
And darling then
I read again
Right from the start
Love letters straight
From your heart

I memorize every line
And I kiss the name
That you sign
And darling then
I read again
Right from the start
Love letters straight
From your heart
